# Taxi Fare Prediction Data Analysis

Welcome to the Taxi Fare Prediction Data Analysis project!

## About

This project aims to analyze taxi fare data to predict the fare amount for taxi rides. By applying machine learning techniques to historical taxi trip data, we can build predictive models that estimate the fare amount based on various factors such as distance traveled, time of day, and geographic location.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of historical taxi trip records, including information such as pickup and drop-off locations, trip duration, passenger count, and fare amount. The dataset is available in CSV format and can be downloaded from [link to dataset].

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleanse and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of variables, correlations, and patterns within the data.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identify relevant features and select the most informative variables for building predictive models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared.

## Results

The results of the analysis will be summarized in terms of model performance metrics, feature importance, and insights gained from the exploratory data analysis.
